<!--This lesson introduced the property justify-content, which is used to control the alignment of elements within a flex container.  Values for the property include center, which moves the elements to the center of the container, flex-start, which moves elements to the start of the container (left for rows, top for columns), flex-end, which moves elements to the end of the container (right for rows, bottom for columns), space-between, which forces the first and last items to the start and end of the container with elements spaced evenly in between, and space-around, which aligns all elements around the center of the main axis with even space before and after each element.  These options provide great flexibility in designing the format of a page.-->
