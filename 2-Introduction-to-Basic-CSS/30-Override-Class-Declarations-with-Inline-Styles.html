<!--This lesson continues to elaborate on specificity rules by demonstrating that inline styling will override styling provided by class and ID selectors.  However, given that IDs should be unique to a given element, it is hard for me to imagine the practical situation in which a developer would use inline styling to override ID styling.-->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text" style="color: white">Hello World!</h1>
