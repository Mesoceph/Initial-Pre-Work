<!--This lesson reviews how to style elements by adding style properties to the body element selector.  This technique is useful for setting style characteristics that will be consistent throughout a webpage.  For instance, the developer may wish to make sure that all text on a page uses the same font.  Styling the body element is a way to accomplish this without setting the font-family property for every element selector separately.-->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }

</style>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
