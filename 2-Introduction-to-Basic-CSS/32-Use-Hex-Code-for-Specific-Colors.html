<!--This lesson introduces hex code that can be used to specify colors.  Hex code is base-16, which it achieves by using the numbers 0-9 and then the letters A-F.  Two base-16 characters together can then be used to signify any value for red, blue, and green components between 0 and 255 (256 total possible values for each component).  Hex code allows access to a much wider variety of colors than the few named colors that can be used in CSS.-->
