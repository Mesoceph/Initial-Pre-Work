//In this lesson, I learned how to use the length property combined with bracket notation to select the last character in a string.  To select the last character, use the expression variableName.length - 1 inside the brackets.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1];
