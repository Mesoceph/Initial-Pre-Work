//In this lesson, I learned to access data that is stored within an array using bracket notation.  Bracket notation works very similarly for an array as it does for strings.

// Example
var ourArray = [50,60,70];
var ourData = ourArray[0]; // equals 50

// Setup
var myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line.

var myData = myArray[0];
