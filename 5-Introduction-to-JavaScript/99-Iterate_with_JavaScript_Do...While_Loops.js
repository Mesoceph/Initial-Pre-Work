//This lesson introduces do...while loops.  These loops work the same way as regular while loops except that the first iteration of the loop runs regardless of whether or not the loop condition is true.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5)
