//This lesson covers how to use bracket notation to find a character other than the first character.  As mentioned before, the first character is character 0, the second is character 1, etc.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
