//This lesson taught me how to use both the augmented addition operator and variables with string data types in concatenation.

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "easy!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
