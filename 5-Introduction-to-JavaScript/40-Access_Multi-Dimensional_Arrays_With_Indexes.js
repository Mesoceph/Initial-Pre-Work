//This lesson shows how to access data stored within nested arrays, called multi-dimensional arrays.  The format is to list the index for each array starting at the first level or outer-most array in brackets, followed by the index for the second level or second-to-outside array in brackets, etc.

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
