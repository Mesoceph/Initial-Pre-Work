//This lesson reviews how to concatenate strings using the plus (+) operator.  Of note is that spaces need to be added at the beginning or end of the concatenated strings if the final string should have space between the concatenated strings.

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start." + " This is the end.";
