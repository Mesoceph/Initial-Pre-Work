//This lesson reviews the fact that uninitialized values have a value of undefined, which is one of the seven JavaScript data types.  This lesson also demonstrates that variables with values of the "number" data type can be used in mathematical operations, while variable types of the "string" data type can be concatenated with other strings.  However, neither of these operations can be performed on an uninitialized variable of data type "undefined".

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
