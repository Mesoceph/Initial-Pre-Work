//This lesson explains how bracket notation can be used to designate a specific character in a string.  It is important to note that the counting for character position starts at 0, not at 1.  Bracket notation uses the syntax variableName[characterr number].

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
