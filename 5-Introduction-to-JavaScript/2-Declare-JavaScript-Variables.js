//This lesson reviewed how to declare variables in JavaScript using the keyword var followed by the variable name.  Variable names can contain letters, numbers, $, and _, but cannot start with a number and cannot contain spaces.  This lesson also reviewed the seven data types used by Javascript: strings, numbers, undefined, null, boolean, symbol, and object.

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line

var myName;
