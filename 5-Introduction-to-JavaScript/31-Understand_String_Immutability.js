//This lesson explains that bracket notation cannot be used to change a single character of a literal string.  Instead, the variable must be replaced by assigning a new string to the variable.

// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line

myStr = "Hello World"; // Fix Me
