<!--In this lesson, I learned to use a hash symbol with an element id in an anchor reference to create an internal link (one that jumps to a different section of the current webpage).  In order for this to work, an element elsewhere on the page must have the id specified in the anchor reference.  The target attribute provides a way to specify if the link created by an anchor tag opens in the current window/tab or in a new one.  In this case, because we were creating an internal link, we removed the target attribute to revert to the default behavior of opening in the current window or tab.-->
