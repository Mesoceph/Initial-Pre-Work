<!--In this lesson, I reviewed how to add an image to a website with the self-closing img tag.  I also reviewed the alt attribute for img tags that provides alternative text.  Alt text is important in case the image cannot display so that the user knows what would normally show in that location.  It also improves accessibility for visually disabled users.-->
