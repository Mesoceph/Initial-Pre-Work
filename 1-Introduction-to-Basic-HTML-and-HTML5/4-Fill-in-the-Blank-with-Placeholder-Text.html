<!-- In this lesson, I learned to use lorem ipsum text- or in this case, kitty ipsum text- as a placeholder for future text.  This could be useful if a developer is creating the code for the front end of a website, but the client or another coworker is responsible for writing the text that will be presented on the website.-->

<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
