<!--In this lesson, I learned about other units that can be used to specify the width of the columns in the grid-template-columns property.  Most of these units, such as %, px, and em, are ones that we have seen before in this pre-work assignment.  Of note are the values auto, which sets the width to that of the column's content, and fr, which divides the (remaining) width of the container into fractions.  The total number of fractions is the total of the fr coefficients, and the number of fractions assigned to each column is determined by that column's coefficient.  For instance, grid-template-columns: 2fr 3fr 1fr; would divide the container width by 6, and assign 2/6 (1/3) to the first column, 3/6 (1/2) to the second column, and 1/6 to the third and final column.  It is also worth noting that these different units can be combined for a single grid-template-columns property.-->
