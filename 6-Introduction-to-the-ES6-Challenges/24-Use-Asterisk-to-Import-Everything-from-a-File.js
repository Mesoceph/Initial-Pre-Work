//This lesson builds on the last two lessons by introducing import * statements.  Using the asterisk will import all of the file contents into the current file.  The syntax is: import * as newObjectName from "fileName".  As woith other import statements, the file name must also contain the file path if it is not in the same directory as the current file.

"use strict";

import * as capitalizeStrings from "capitalize_strings";
