//In this lesson, I learned that the rest operator can be used to catch the subarray that is not reassigned to specific variables when using destructuring assignment.  Note that the rest operator can only be used as the last variable in the destructuring assignment.

const source = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
  "use strict";
  // change code below this line
  const [a, b, ...arr] = list; // change this
  // change code above this line
  return arr;
}
const arr = removeFirstTwo(source);
console.log(arr); // should be [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
console.log(source); // should be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
